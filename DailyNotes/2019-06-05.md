### General comments:
* This is the first entry into this folder. I will be putting a summary of what I have done as well as thoughts and ideas here for self-reference. I do not expect anyone else to read this.
* Prior to today, I have been reading some papers and tutorials.
* I will be writing rough notes here during the day, then tidying it before leaving so that I have notes for future reference.


### Thoughts:
* The aim is to make a GAN to generate time-series data. RNNs are being looked into 


### What has been done:
* Udemy tutorial on RNNs
* Plan has been updated (https://www.overleaf.com/read/cvgqnmwzdcmf)
* MotionSense repo (https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/motion-sense) downloaded and experimented with to make sure I can get plots

### Plan for tomorrow:
* Re-read remaining papers that I read a few months ago and annotate.
* Look more into RNNs
* Centre for Smart Connected Futures Seminar (17:30, Huxley 311)
